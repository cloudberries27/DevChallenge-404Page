- The demo is above ^^
- This took me around 30 min to do 
- Kinda already knew everything, but I'm sure theres like better syntax or naming for some things
- Wisdom?? Umm I'm still too much of a noob to be giving out wisdom. Maybe using flex box and flex direction column will be some of your best friends for responsive design...imo
